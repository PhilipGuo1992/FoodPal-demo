# FoodPal - a social dining application

We intend to create a mobile application called **FoodPal** that is an easy-to-use social dining application for students at Dalhousie. Since the target users for this application are students at Dalhousie, they need to have a Dalhousie email address to register for an account. Users can use this application to do several things: create a dine out group that other users can join, join an existing group that was created by other users, check a list of restaurants near **Dalhousie University** and in Halifax, and modify their profiles.

## Purpose and Benefits

People enjoy good food. Imagine that you just come to a new place and want to try some local restaurants, but you do not want to eat alone. You want to find someone who has the same taste so that you can enjoy food together. Or you just want to go out and eat something, and you want to find the right place with the right person.

FoodPal is here for you. FoodPal is a Food & Social application. It is designed for students at Dalhousie. It aims at bringing students together who have the same taste in food. Users can search for local restaurants, and give reviews for the restaurants they visit. Other people can read previous reviews, and decide to try a restaurant or not.

This application is a good opportunity for people to try different foods, meet new people, and build friendships. FoodPal is a fantastic application. It can also help students improve their social skills by meeting new people **offline!**

## Target Audiences

Users, i.e., the students at Dalhousie, sometimes can be hungry, alone, looking to try some new restaurants, but may not find anyone, or are just bored. They can use our application to find someone who shares the same interests as they do, and dine out together. The app would use **Android-based mobile phones or tablets** and users are expected to using this app on campus, at home or anywhere they have network access.
