# FoodPal
We intend to create a mobile application called FoodPal that is an easy-to-use social dining application for students at Dalhousie. Since the target users for this application are students at Dalhousie, they need to have a Dalhousie email address to register for an account. Users can use this application to do several things: create a dine out group that other users can join, join an existing group that was created by other users, check a list of restaurants near Dalhousie University and in Halifax, and modify their profiles.

## Libraries

**FirebaseUI for Android:** FirebaseUI database is used to bind data from the Firebase realtime database. It allows us to use a recyclerView much easier. Source [here](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android/blob/master/database/README.md)

## Code Examples

**Problem 1: In the beginning, the model design is a challenge.**

The many-to-many relationship need to be managed well in Firebase. For our project, we have users and groups. Each user can join many groups, and each group can have many users, which is a many-to-many relationship. We used Map to manage the relationship.  In Firebase, we stored the groups’ id in the user file, also we stored the user’s id to the group file.
```
//  the user model
public class User {
   private String userID;
   private String userName;
   private String userEmailAddress;
   // user major : like CS, math, ..
   private String userMajor;
   // groups: user belongs to
   private Map<String, Boolean> joinedGroups = new HashMap<>();

//  the usergroup model
public class UserGroup {
   // the group creator: user ID.
   private String groupCreatorID;
   // current members in the group
   private Map<String, Boolean> currentMembers;
   private String groupID;
   private String groupName;
   private String mealTime;
   private String description;
   private String restaurantID;
// default constructor **DO NOT REMOVE THE constructor**
   public UserGroup() {
}
// when user clicks join the group button:
// first: update the group member info
mDatabaseGroup.child("currentMembers").child(currentUserID).setValue(true);
// second: update the user's group info
mDatabaseUsers.child(currentUserID).child("joinedGroups").child(groupID).setValue(true);
```

**Problem 2: Chat functionality.**

We also have tried to implement chat functionality in our group where the users who are added to any specific groups can chat with other users in that group to decide the common place to eat or to meet. So for that we have map the unique groupName ,groupId and userEmail from firebase with this chat functions that i have created with the help of a adapter
```
// add the message to the database
send_messsage.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
   @Override
   public void onClick(View view) {
              message = chatbox.getText().toString();
       chatbox.setText("");

       chatDatabaseReference = FirebaseDatabase.getInstance().getReference().child("groups").child(groupId).child("Chat").push();
       final FirebaseUser mUser = firebaseAuth.getCurrentUser();
       chatDatabaseReference.child("Message").setValue(userEmail + " :\n" + message);
       chatDatabaseReference.child("uid").setValue(userEmail);
   }
});
```

**Problem 3: Cropping and saving images.**

We chose circle image view as the user’s profile photo which needs a circle image cropping tool. We introduced Image-Cropper to set up attributes and save the uri of the image to Firebase for retrieving.
```
if (requestCode == CropImage.CROP_IMAGE_ACTIVITY_REQUEST_CODE ) {
   CropImage.ActivityResult result = CropImage.getActivityResult(data);
   if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
       imageUri = result.getUri();
       StorageReference userProfile = imageReference.child(uId + ".jpg");
       //put uri into users
       userProfile.putFile(imageUri).addOnCompleteListener(new OnCompleteListener<UploadTask.TaskSnapshot>() {
           @Override
           public void onComplete(@NonNull Task<UploadTask.TaskSnapshot> task) {
               if (task.isSuccessful()) {
                   String downloadUrl = task.getResult().getDownloadUrl().toString();
                   Map<String, Object> userMap = new HashMap<>();
                   userMap.put("photoUrl", downloadUrl);
                   userReference.updateChildren(userMap);
                   SETTING = true;
                   imageStore.collection("users").document(uId).set(userMap).addOnSuccessListener(new OnSuccessListener<Void>() {
                       @Override
                       public void onSuccess(Void aVoid) {
                           Toast.makeText(getActivity(), "Success!", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
                          // goToFragment();
                       }
                   });
               } else {
                   Toast.makeText(getActivity(),"Error!",Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
               }
           }
       });
       circleImageViewPhoto.setImageURI(imageUri);
   }
```

## Feature Section
The login and registration page is the first page that users see when they open the application. After they registered, they are on the page of Profile, where they can edit their personal information.
On the list of groups page, user can view all the existing groups created by other users. The user can click each group, which will show the detail of the group.
